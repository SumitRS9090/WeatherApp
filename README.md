# 🌤️ Weather App

[Live Demo 🔗](https://weatherappsrs.netlify.app/)

This is a simple weather web application that displays real-time weather data for any city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project is my first hands-on experience working with APIs and fetching real-time data.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Search by City**: Enter any city name to get current weather details.
- 🌡️ **Temperature**: Shows the current temperature in Celsius.
- 💧 **Humidity**: Displays the percentage of humidity.
- 🌬️ **Wind Speed**: Gives the current wind speed in km/h.
- ☁️ **Weather Description**: Describes the current weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy).
- 🖼️ **Weather Icons**: Displays relevant weather icons fetched from the API.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly and works well on all screen sizes.
